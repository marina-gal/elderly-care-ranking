# Elderly Care Homes Analysis & Scoring Model

**Objective:**
The goal of this project is to evaluate and rank elderly care homes across multiple performance dimensions—including staffing levels, average waiting time, infection rate, IT readiness, and resident satisfaction. The analysis follows a complete end-to-end workflow: exploring the raw data, cleaning and standardizing the dataset, transforming indicators into 0–100 scores, and producing a final composite quality score for each care home.

### Data Preparation
- Raw data cleaned and standardized
- Variables transformed into 0–100 scoring scale
- Missing values handled appropriately

### Methodology
1. Converted key metrics into standardized scores
2. Calculated dimension scores
3. Computed an overall ranking score per care home

### Results
No single care home performs well across all dimensions.

Each top performer succeeds in different areas:
Care Home 3 → Waiting Time, Infection Rate, IT
Care Home 7 → Waiting Time, Staffing
Care Home 1 → Infection Rate, Staffing
Care Home 2 → Satisfaction, Infection Rate
Care Home 9 → IT, Satisfaction

The industry likely suffers from imbalanced performance, where strengths in one dimension often come with weaknesses in others.

### Key Skills
- Data cleaning and preprocessing  
- Designing scoring systems  
- Creating transparent and reproducible evaluation models  
- Working with real-world, imperfect data  
- Clear structuring of an end-to-end analytical workflow
